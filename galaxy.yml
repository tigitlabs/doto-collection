# A list of file glob-like patterns used to filter any files or directories that should not be included in the build
# artifact. A pattern is matched from the relative path of the file or directory of the collection directory. This
# uses 'fnmatch' to match the files or directories. Some directories and files like 'galaxy.yml', '*.pyc', '*.retry',
# and '.git' are always filtered. Mutually exclusive with 'manifest'
build_ignore: []

# A dict controlling use of manifest directives used in building the collection artifact. The key 'directives' is a
# list of MANIFEST.in style
# L(directives,https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/using-manifest-in/#manifest-in-commands). The key
# 'omit_default_directives' is a boolean that controls whether the default directives are used. Mutually exclusive
# with 'build_ignore'
# manifest: null
